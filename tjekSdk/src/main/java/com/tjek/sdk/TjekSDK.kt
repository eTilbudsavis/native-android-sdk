     * Parameters:
     * - enableLogCatMessages (default=false): allow the sdk to print messages in the LogCat. **Only available for debug builds**, so logging if off for release builds
     * - networkLogLevel (default=None): change the log level of the underlying okHttp client. **Only available for debug builds**.
     * - endpointEnvironment (default=Production): environment hit by the TjekAPIs. **Staging is only for development and it can be outdated/unstable**.
     * - eventEnvironment (default=Production): environment used by the event tracker. **Staging is only for development**.
     * - isDevelop (default=false): flag to enable develop features (logging, develop keys, etc.). Set it to your BuildConfig.DEBUG.
